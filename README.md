## üå≥ About The Project

Tree Vision Buddy is a user-friendly tool that makes tree identification simple and accessible to everyone. The project solves the common problem of not being able to identify a tree by allowing users to upload a photo and get an instant, AI-powered analysis.

The application provides the tree's common and scientific names, key characteristics, and a confidence score for the identification. It's built for students, nature enthusiasts, and anyone curious about the world around them.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **AI-Powered Identification:** Upload an image or use your device's camera to get an instant species identification.
* **Comprehensive Database:** Browse and search a rich database of tree species, complete with descriptions, characteristics, and more.
* **Identification History:** Automatically saves your past identifications to your browser's local storage.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher) and `npm` installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/shriyashsawant/Aicte_TreeSpecies_Shriyash.git](https://github.com/shriyashsawant/Aicte_TreeSpecies_Shriyash.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Aicte_TreeSpecies_Shriyash
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Supabase Setup

This project requires a Supabase backend to function correctly.

1.  Go to [Supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2.  In the root of your local project, create a new file named `.env.local`.
3.  Add your Supabase Project URL and Anon Key to this file:
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    ```
    *You can find these keys in your Supabase project's "API Settings".*
4.  You will also need to set up the `fetch-kaggle-dataset` Edge Function within your Supabase project for the dataset loader to work.

### Running the Application

Start the development server. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

```sh
npm run dev
```
