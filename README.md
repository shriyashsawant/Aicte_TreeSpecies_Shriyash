Tree Vision Buddy üåøAn AI-powered web application to identify tree species from images. Built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Supabase.[Link to Live Demo] (You can add a link here once it's deployed)üå≥ About The ProjectTree Vision Buddy is a user-friendly tool that makes tree identification simple and accessible to everyone. The project solves the common problem of not being able to identify a tree by allowing users to upload a photo and get an instant, AI-powered analysis.The application provides the tree's common and scientific names, key characteristics, and a confidence score for the identification. It's built for students, nature enthusiasts, and anyone curious about the world around them.‚ú® Key FeaturesAI-Powered Identification: Upload an image or use your device's camera to get an instant species identification.Comprehensive Database: Browse and search a rich database of tree species, complete with descriptions, characteristics, and more.Identification History: Automatically saves your past identifications to your browser's local storage.Favorites System: Save interesting trees to a "Favorites" tab for quick access.GPS Location Tagging: Optionally add your current location to an identification.Scalable Backend: Uses Supabase for database storage and serverless functions to handle heavy tasks like dataset processing.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackThis project is built with a modern, scalable tech stack:Frontend: React, Vite, TypeScriptUI: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UIBackend & Database: SupabaseData Fetching: Tanstack QueryRouting: React RouterAI/ML Dataset: Kaggle: 5M Trees DatasetüöÄ Getting StartedTo get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.PrerequisitesYou will need Node.js (version 18 or higher) and npm installed on your machine.InstallationClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/shriyashsawant/Aicte_TreeSpecies_Shriyash.git
Navigate to the project directory:cd Aicte_TreeSpecies_Shriyash
Install NPM packages:npm install
Supabase SetupThis project requires a Supabase backend to function correctly.Go to Supabase.com and create a new project.In the root of your local project, create a new file named .env.local.Add your Supabase Project URL and Anon Key to this file:VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
You can find these keys in your Supabase project's "API Settings".You will also need to set up the fetch-kaggle-dataset Edge Function within your Supabase project for the dataset loader to work.Running the ApplicationStart the development server. The application will be available at http://localhost:8080.npm run dev
